# CAENet-ASD
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that manifests through a range of symptoms, including difficulties in social communication, impaired social interaction, and restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. It is estimated to affect approximately one in every 68 children in the United States, though the presentation of symptoms and their severity can vary widely between individuals. Currently, the diagnostic process for ASD relies heavily on behavioral assessments conducted by clinicians. While these methods have proven valuable, they are inherently subjective and can result in inconsistencies across evaluations, particularly when symptoms are subtle or overlap with other developmental conditions.
